# FUD

## The Why
I got really tired of having to rely on tools like [LAN Sweeper](https://www.lansweeper.com/) and [SCCM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/) to find the exact current user on a given device within an AD network. I wanted to see where a set user account is signed in, and I wanted that data in a nice orderly fashion. Perhaps with just one simple PowerShell command.

## The How
Who knows

## Current Features
None

## Pipeline Features
* Retrieve list of signed in assets based on AD user ID
* Select a network active device and retrieve all cached user accounts
